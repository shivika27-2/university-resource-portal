PROJECT STATEMENT : University Resource Management Portal (URMP)
Student Name: Shivika Patidar Registration No.: 25BAI110101
# Problem Statement
University campuses face persistent operational inefficiencies in the manual or fragmented management of shared academic resources, such as specialized lab equipment, departmental seminar halls, and reserved library assets. This lack of a centralized system leads directly to:
1.Scheduling Conflicts: Double-booking resources, causing disruption to classes and research.
2.Lack of Visibility: Students and faculty cannot easily determine real-time availability or the location of critical resources.
3.Administrative Burden: Excessive time spent by staff on managing booking ledgers, tracking returns, and resolving disputes.

The absence of a reliable, automated system hinders academic productivity and effective resource planning within the institution.

# Scope of the Project
The University Resource Management Portal (URMP) is designed to solve these problems by providing a complete, web-based platform for resource scheduling.
1.Inclusions (What the project covers):
1.1Core Functionality: User authentication, resource inventory management (CRUD), real-time booking/reservation, and automated conflict detection.
1.2Notifications: System-generated alerts (e.g., email reminders) for booking confirmations and overdue resources.
1.3Reporting: Generation of usage and inventory analytics for administrative staff.

2.Exclusions (What the project does NOT cover):
2.1Physical Tracking: The project does not include integration with hardware like RFID, QR codes, or physical sensors for item check-in/out
2.2Financial Transactions: No payment gateways or fee calculation modules are included.
2.3External Integration: No integration with the University's main ERP, student information systems, or third-party email providers (beyond basic system mailers).

# Target Users
The system caters to the specific access and management needs of three distinct user roles:
1.Students (End-Users): Primarily use the system to search for and book available resources for academic assignments and self-study
2.Faculty (Priority Users): Use the system to book resources for teaching, research, and lab sessions, often with priority or bulk booking privileges.3.Administrators (System Managers): Responsible for system configuration, managing the resource inventory (adding/removing equipment), setting user permissions, and generating institutional reports.
# High-level Features
The core functionalities provided by the URMP are structured into three major functional modules:
(A).Users & Roles Management
1.Secure Role-Based Access: Users log in via a secure system, and permissions (e.g., booking limits, administrative tools) are assigned based on their role (Student, Faculty, Admin)
2.Resource CRUD Operations: Administrators can easily Create, Read, Update, and Delete resources from the inventory, maintaining accurate stock levels and resource categorization.
(B). Easy Booking
1.Real-time Calendar View: An interactive interface that shows resource availability in real-time, allowing users to select non-conflicting time slots for reservation.
2.Automated Conflict Detection: The system performs immediate validation checks on all booking attempts to prevent overlapping reservations, ensuring reliability.
(C). Usage Reports
1.Data Compilation & Analysis: The system automatically compiles data on popular resources, usage trends, and tracks overdue items and high-frequency users
2.Exportable Reports: Generated reports are exportable (e.g., as CSV or PDF files) for detailed analysis and planning by administrative staff.
